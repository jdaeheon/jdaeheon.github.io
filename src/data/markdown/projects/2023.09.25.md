VirtualPicasso is an experimental project about the collaborative interaction between humans and AI agents in viewing artwork. It aims to understand how AI can assist humans in constructivist learning, cultivating a more lightweight yet effective way of viewing the artwork. From a fun imagination observing how the museum visitors behave within the exhibitory setting, the VirtualPicasso started with an easy question "Can the AI be an enjoyable companion who brings a theather-like experience to the solemn environment primarily known as the White Box?" Through the demonstration of the VirtualPicasso, our team was able to see a variety of expectations given the concept from the participants and the corresponding various interactions. VirtualPicasso, primarily through the demonstration of its potential to imitate the well-known figure, suggests a possibility that lies within the narrative presentation of education.
