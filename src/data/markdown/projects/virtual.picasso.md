VirtualPicasso is an experimental project about the collaborative interaction between humans and AI agents in viewing artwork. It aims to understand how AI can assist humans in constructivist learning, cultivating a more lightweight yet effective way of viewing the artwork. From an observation of how the museum visitors behave within the exhibitory setting, the VirtualPicasso started with an easy question "Can the AI be an enjoyable companion who brings a theather-like experience to the solemn environment primarily known as the White Box?" Through the demonstration of the VirtualPicasso, our team was able to see a variety of expectations given the concept from the participants and the corresponding various interactions. VirtualPicasso, primarily through the demonstration of its potential to imitate the well-known figure, suggests a possibility that lies within the narrative presentation of education.

Within the design of the VirtualPicasso, to explore the theme in-depth, our team initiated the project with a formative study with a group of docents. The study was conducted with the painting Guernica, with the agent imitating Pablo Picasso. We selected specifically Guernica, because of its abstract nature and full of hidden symbols with multitudes of possible interpretations. On interaction with the agent, the docents have shown various behaviors, especially giving a question that aims to measure the possible limitation of the agent. Within the study, we identified a range of ideas, including comparative analysis between paintings or contextual coherency in dialogue dependent on the time the painting was produced.

Based on these experiences, we improvised an enhancement mainly involving the knowledge graph model. With the help of AuraDB from neo4j and Cypher language, a custom-designed graph model was structured to provide more accurate and narratively abundant answers to the user via the language model. The implementation showed a strong positive response from the user when all functions performed as expected. Yet, due to its limited robustness, mainly caused by inconsistency in the language model, there was variation in the response.

The study, we found that users had a high level of expectation given the idea of a virtual Picasso. It was assumed to give them a personalized experience with a degree of social interaction. The characterized agent has room for potential, as it can bring in a role-play-like aspect to the education. We hope to further extend the knowledge over the characterized agent, and the VirtualPicasso is a proof-of-concept suggesting various implications within the direction.
