<!-- The conversational audio guide is an experimental project about the collaborative interaction between humans and AI agents in viewing artwork. It aims to understand how AI can assist humans in constructivist learning, cultivating a more lightweight yet effective way of viewing the artwork. From an observation of how the museum visitors behave within the exhibitory setting, the conversational audio guide started with an easy question *"Can the AI be an enjoyable companion who brings a theather-like experience to the solemn environment primarily known as the White Box?"* Through the demonstration of the Conversational audio guide, our team was able to see a variety of expectations given the concept from the participants and the corresponding various interactions. The conversational audio guide, primarily through the demonstration of its potential to imitate the well-known figure, suggests a possibility that lies within the narrative presentation of education via AI. -->

<!-- The study, we found that users had a high level of expectation given the idea of the conversational audio guide. It was assumed to give them a personalized experience with a degree of social interaction. The characterized agent has room for potential, as it can bring in a role-play-like aspect to the education. We hope to further extend the knowledge over the characterized agent, and the conversational audio guide is a proof-of-concept suggesting various implications within the direction. -->
