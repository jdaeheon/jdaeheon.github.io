I'm a master's student in KAIST GSAI, conducting research at KAIST Interaction Lab ([KIXLab](https://www.kixlab.org/)).
My research focuses on augmenting human knowledge work through artificial intelligence.
I'm currently advised by [Prof. Juho Kim](https://juhokim.com/).

Previously, I have led and contributed to several research projects in this area.
These projects involved developing AI systems to support human expertise and cognition.
I have been advised by [Prof. Daehyun Kim](https://dhkim16.github.io/), [Prof. Yongsoon Choi](http://lifestylemedia.org/), and [Prof. Giseop Kim](https://sites.google.com/view/aprl-dgist/people).
