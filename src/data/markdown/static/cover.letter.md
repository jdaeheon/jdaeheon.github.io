I'm a master's student in KAIST GSAI, conducting research at KAIST Interaction Lab ([KIXLab](https://www.kixlab.org/)).
My interest lies in augmenting human skills through multimodal artificial intelligence.
I'm currently advised by [Prof. Juho Kim](https://juhokim.com/) and [Prof. Daehyun Kim](https://dhkim16.github.io/).

Previously, I've actively organized several projects related to the topic.
These projects navigate the topic of artificial intelligence, visualization, and accessibility.
With projects, I was advised by [Prof. Yongsoon Choi](http://lifestylemedia.org/) and [Prof. Giseop Kim](https://sites.google.com/view/aprl-dgist/people).
