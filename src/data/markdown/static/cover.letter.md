Hi, I'm an undergraduate student at [Sogang University](https://wwwe.sogang.ac.kr/wwwe/index_new.html), expected to graduate in Spring, 2024. I'm pursuing majors in both economics and software.

Being advised by [Prof. Yongsoon Choi](http://lifestylemedia.org/), chair of Art and Technology at Sogang University, I organized multiple undergraduate HCI research projects with skilled teammates.

My research interests are HAI, visualization, graphics, and accessibility. Specifically, I'm looking for a research training opportunity augmenting the usability of conversational agents by implementing a personality.
